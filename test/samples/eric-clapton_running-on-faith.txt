Running On Faith by Eric Clapton

[G]Lately I've been  [D/F#]running on [Em]faith     [D/F#]
[G]What else can a [D/F#]poor boy [Em]do     [G7]
But my [C]world will be right         [D]
When Love comes over [G]me    [C]      [D]     [D7]

[G]Lately I've been [D/F#]talking in my [Em]sleep      [D/F#]
[G]I can't imaging what I'd [D/F#]have to [Em]say       [G7]
Except my [C]world wouldn't be right    [D]
When Love comes back your [G]way   [C]    [G]        [G7]

chorus
[C]I've always [B7]been
[Em]One to [G7]take each and every[C]day     [C/B]
[A]seems like by now
I find a love who [C]cares, cares just for [D]me     [D7]

Then we'd  go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When Love comes over me and you

Solo: chords as in verse 2

Chorus

[G]Then we'd go [D/F#]running on [Em]faith     [D/F#]
